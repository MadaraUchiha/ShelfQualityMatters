# Shelf Quality Matters

This small mod makes it so shelves' quality informs the number of items that can be stored in it

## Quality to Items-per-cell:

- Awful => 1
- Poor => 2
- Normal => 3
- Good => 4
- Excellent => 5
- Masterwork => 6
- Legendary => 10

## Incompatibilities

- This mod patches `Building_Storage` - mods that add items that inherit from that will have their values overridden
- I have not tested this with any other storage mods (eg. Deep Storage), but it's likely that the two are incomaptible.
- Mods that change stack sizes should be compatible with this mod
